Overview

This data server provides remotely accessible python objects (using the
SharedObject library) to allow usage of HDF5 files from multiple processes.
The main objects it provides are thin wrappers around the h5py library. In
addition to the expected functionality they provide signals to integrate with
interactive programs. For example a data group emits a 'changed' signal so
that GUIs can re-process and plot data as wanted.
