        <body><h1>ATS330 Python sample programs</h1>

<p>ATS-SDK version 6.2.0</p>

<p>© 2003-2015 Alazar Technologies, Inc.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This folder contains sample programs that demonstrate how to make the
various types of acquisitions supported by an AlazarTech
ATS330 12-bit 50 MS/s digitizer board with
a PCI host bus interface. The sample programs are part of the
AlazarTech SDK, and are documented in the “AlazarTech SDK Programmer’s
Guide”.</p>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>Python 2.7.8 and above, as well as 3.4.0 and above are supported for
running these sample programs. In addition to the standard Python
installation, the NumPy library is required. This sample code is
tested with NumPy 1.8.2.</p>

<p>The AlazarTech ATS330 drivers version 5.7.7
of later are required to run the sample program. They can be
downloaded from <a href="http://www.alazartech.com/support/downloads.htm">our
website</a>.</p>

<p>ATS330 has a PCI bus interface capable of sustained data
transfers up to 133 MB/s.</p>

<p>Many sample programs require a trigger input signal. Connect a 500
mVpp, 1kHz sine wave from a function generator to the CH A connector
of the digitizer board before running these programs. If a suitable
trigger signal is not supplied, an acquisition timeout internal will
expire before the board receives the number of trigger events required
to make the acquisition and, as a result, the acquisition will fail
with a timeout error.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>To get the most from an AlazarTech ATS330 digitizer board, a
programmer should:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Read the "ATS330 User Guide". It provides an overview of
the digitizer board's hardware features, as well as it's
specifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the "AlazarTech SDK Programmer's Guide". It describes how to
program the digitizier hardware to make an acquisition, and to
transfer sample data into application buffers.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Single-port acquisitions</h2>

<p>A single-port acquisition allows a board to acquire to on-board memory
and, after the acquisition is complete, transfer sample data from
on-board memory to application buffers.</p>

<p>Single-port acquisitions should be used when:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The application can tolerate missing trigger events while it
transfers data from on-board memory, and re-arms a board for
another acquisition.</p></li>
<li><p>The average data acquisition data rate that is greater than the
maximum PCIe bus transfer rate.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Single-port acquisitions should not be used for imaging applications
such as: ultrasonic testing, OCT, RADAR, and LIDAR. These applications
should use Dual-port AutoDMA acquisitions described below.
Single-port samples</p>

<h2>Single-port samples</h2>

<p>The samples in the “SinglePort” directory demonstrate how to make
single-port acquisitions. Most programmers should begin with the
“SinglePort\AR” sample.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""../../Samples_Python/ATS330/AR/ReadMe.htm"">ATS330_AR.py</a> : This sample acquires records to on-board memory, and calls AlazarRead to transfer entire records from on-board memory to an application buffer. It demonstrates a basic single-port acquisition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Utility samples</h2>

<p>The following sample programs demonstrate how to get informatin about
a board.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../AlazarSysInfo/ReadMe.htm">AlazarSysInfo</a> : This sample calls a
number of status and information API functions to display detailed
information about digitizer boards. This information includes:
sample size in bits, memory size in samples per channel, serial
number, and latest calibration date. It demonstrates how to obtain
a board handle, use the status and information API functions, and
control the LED on a board’s PCIe mounting bracket.</li>
</ul>
